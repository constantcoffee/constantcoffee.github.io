# The right booking agent is IMPORTANT.
Here's a quick list of stuff that I've picked up for choosing the right booking agent.

## Before you have an agent:
* Make sure you can play to a decent sized crowd, from a performance standpoint
    * practice, practice, practice. *You can't just be good in the studio.*
* Can handle your rudimentary finances (i.e. avoid “pay to play” gigs, really think of your cost-benefit for a gig)
* Have some handle on your merch situation (which is a _whole other story_ )

## The right booking agent will:
* Always hear out your art!
* Always hear YOU out to figure out what kind of audiences you want to play to.
* Have an understanding of the booking landscape.
* Make creative/smart suggestions for gigs that you’ll play.
    * ...ideally backed up by data to ensure financial success
    * If a potential booking agent doesn't ask you for a "gig audit", *dump them*
* Check in with you and your team to have a strong short/medium-term outlook.
* Know to how cut deals that are in your favor (versus deals, multiple-show deals etc)
* Keep an eye out for creative/cost-effective suggestions in the live sphere (you/your team should be leading this discussion, imo; but they shouldn’t be dumb)

## Once you have an agent, you will:
* Defer to them for your gigs, even if its something you REALLY want to take (i.e. something for a homie)
* Check in on them for larger gigs
* Make sure they are being transparent with you for accounting
* Treat them like a smart collaborator
