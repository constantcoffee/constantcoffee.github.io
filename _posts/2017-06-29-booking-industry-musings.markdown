# The right booking agent is IMPORTANT.
Here's a quick list of stuff that I've picked up for choosing the right booking agent after working with two of the world's largest agencies for some of world's finest artists.

## Before you have an agent:
* **You can't just be good in the studio.**
* Make sure you can play to a decent sized crowd, from a performance standpoint
	* ### This is a million times more important than anything you could ever do on social media.
	    * Lay off the social media unless you want to make shirts, photos or anything _but_ music.
    * practice, practice, practice.
    * be comfortable on stage.
    * give people a show, not a gear circle jerk (unless that's your audience, at which point I'll STFU).
    * Please, for the love of God, *relax with the backing tracks*
* Can handle your rudimentary finances (i.e. avoid “pay to play” gigs, really think of your cost-benefit for a gig)
* Have some handle on your merch situation (which is a _whole other story_, but please start somewhere!)

## The right booking agent will:
* Always hear out your art!
* Be absolutely clear about finances (i.e. what percentage they're getting)
* Always hear YOU out to figure out what kind of audiences you want to play to.
* Have an understanding of the booking landscape.
* Make creative/smart suggestions for gigs that you’ll play.
    * ...ideally backed up by data to ensure financial success
    * If a potential booking agent doesn't ask you for a "gig audit", *dump them*
* Make sure that you're evolving in your career.
   * You don't want to be the backpack rapper/producer who keeps playing the same 4-5 local gigs over and over. If you are, that's the agent's fault logistically and your fault for literally everything else.
* Check in with you and your team to have a strong short/medium-term outlook for touring and how that fits into your financial picture
* Know to how cut deals that are in your favor (versus deals, multiple-show deals etc)
* Keep an eye out for creative/cost-effective suggestions in the live sphere (you/your team should be leading this discussion, imo; but the agent shouldn’t be dumb)
* Have a strong handle on paperwork, because _paperwork is what keeps people honest_. From tech and hospitality riders, to merch splits, *everything should be in writing*

## Once you have an agent, you will:
* Defer to them for your gigs, even if its something you REALLY want to take (i.e. something for a homie)
	* This establishes a professional level of trust, which will pay off in so many different ways.
* Check in on them for larger gigs to make sure that you are good to go (esp. if you're a supporting act)
* Make sure they are being transparent with you for accounting

## Sidenote
* If you have a tour/road manager, they should be your liaision towards the booking agent.
* If anything goes wrong on the road, always try to settle it kindly and personably. If that doesn't work, your road manager should have your back.
